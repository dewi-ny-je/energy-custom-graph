# Energy Custom Graph
This card provides a lightweight graph that supports the Home Assistant energy date picker for time range selection. It reuses the built-in ECharts instance shipped with Home Assistant, so you get native styling with minimal overhead.

Unlike the default energy cards like `energy-usage-graph`, this card is not limited to the energy dashboard entities. Any long-term statistic available in the recorder database can be used, as well as the short-term 'raw' history. For aggregated statistics you can choose the type (`change`, `sum`, `mean`, `min`, `max`, `state`) for each series separately.  
<br>
I know the `Statistics graph card` also supports the energy date picker nowadays, but it didn't provide all the features I needed.

## Key Features

- This card has an full-featured graphical editor, so almost all settings can be done through the UI.
- Displayed timespan sync with the energy date picker (`energy-date-selection`).
- Supports any entity that exposes long-term statistics, as well as the short-term 'raw' history.
- Can graph numeric entity attributes (e.g. a thermostat's `current_temperature`), aggregated from recorder history.
- Solar forecast entities that are used in the energy dashboard can also be shown in the charts. 
- Allows to compute and display 'live' values for the current running hour before HA provides the final aggregation.
- Uses Home Assistant's bundled ECharts runtime – no extra framework needs to be loaded.
- Override the energy date pickers default aggregation periods, to e.g. display hourly instead of daily bars when viewing a monthly report.
- Per-series control over aggregation type, chart type (bar, line or step), stacking, color, unit, scaling and offsets.
- Optional fill-between-rendering for line series to fill the space e.g. between min / max line-charts
- Optional manual timespan selection (fixed ranges or relative day/week/month/year offsets) when you don't want to use the energy date picker.
- Support for calculated series, so you can e.g. add and subtract sensor values as a computed signal
- Quick access to colors from the HA energy color palette and native styles so mixed dashboards look consistent.
- Maps boolean strings like `on/off`, `true/false` to the numeric values `0/1`

## Installation

### HACS (recommended)

1. In Home Assistant, open *HACS > Frontend* and click the three-dot menu in the top right.
2. Choose *Custom repositories*, add `https://github.com/Thyraz/energy-custom-graph`, and leave the category set to *Lovelace*.
3. Search for "Energy Custom Graph" in HACS, install the latest release.
4. Reload the browser and clear the Browser cache if the card won't show up immediately.

### Manual installation

1. Download the latest `energycustomgraph.js` from the repository release or the `dist/` folder.
2. Copy it into your Home Assistant config directory, e.g. `config/www/community/energy-custom-graph/energycustomgraph.js`.
3. Add the resource to Lovelace (Settings → Dashboards → Resources → **+ ADD RESOURCE**):
   - URL: `/local/community/energy-custom-graph/energycustomgraph.js`
   - Resource type: `JavaScript Module`
4. Clear your browser cache and Reload the page.

## Usage

Add the card to a dashboard using the graphical card editor or via YAML:

```yaml
type: custom:energy-custom-graph-card
title: Custom energy overview
series:
  - statistic_id: sensor.energy_grid_import
  - statistic_id: sensor.energy_grid_export
    stat_type: change
    chart_type: line
    fill: true
```

The card supports the energy date picker for timespan selection. Set `timespan.mode: "energy"` (which is the default) and place an `energy-date-selection` control on the same dashboard. For other timespan modes, see the `timespan` configuration below.

## Configuration

By default the card mirrors the core energy cards and automatically selects the recorder statistics period (5-minute, hourly, daily, or monthly) based on the chosen timespan. You can override this behaviour via the `aggregation` options described below.  


### Generic card options

| Key | Type | Default | Description |
| --- | ---- | ------- | ----------- |
| `type` | string | – | Must be `custom:energy-custom-graph-card`. |
| `title` | string | – | Optional card header. |
| `header` | object | – | Optional header chip configuration (see below). |
| `chart_height` | string | – | CSS height (e.g. `300px`). Ignored when the card is used inside a section layout (the grid rows control the height). |
| `timespan` | object | `{mode: "energy"}` | Controls the time range displayed (see below). |
| `collection_key` | string | – | Custom key when multiple energy date pickers are present (only for `timespan.mode: "energy"`). <br>[More Info](https://www.home-assistant.io/dashboards/energy/#using-multiple-collections) |
| `allow_compare` | boolean | `true` | For energy date picker mode: Respects the compare toggle when `true`. Set to `false` to disable this behavior. Ignored when any series configures `time_offset`. |
| `hide_legend` | boolean | `false` | Hide the legend entirely. |
| `legend_sort` | `"asc"`, `"desc"`, `"none"` | `"none"` | Sort order for the legend entries. |
| `expand_legend` | boolean | `false` | Expand the legend by default. |
| `show_tooltip` | boolean | `true` | Show the tooltip detail panel on hover or click. Axis pointers can still be shown when this is `false`. |
| `show_x_axis_pointer` | boolean | `true` | Show the vertical hover guide line for the selected X axis position. |
| `show_y_axis_pointer` | boolean | `false` | Show the horizontal hover guide line for the selected Y axis value. |
| `tooltip_precision` | number | – | Override numeric precision in the tooltip. |
| `show_unit` | boolean | `true` | Show corresponding units from the recorder database when available in tooltips and axes. |
| `show_stack_sums` | boolean | `false` | When `true`, adds positive/negative totals for each visible stack to the tooltip. |
| `y_axes` | list | – | Y axis configuration for both left and right axes (see below). |
| `aggregation` | object | auto | Control recorder aggregation intervals. See below. |
| `series` | list | – | One or more series definitions (see below). |

### Timespan options

The `timespan` configuration controls the time range displayed by the card. Currently three modes are supported::

**Mode: `energy` (default)**
```yaml
timespan:
  mode: energy
```
Use a energy date picker on the same dashboard. The card automatically follows the selected range.

**Mode: `relative`**
```yaml
timespan:
  mode: relative
  period: day        # hour, day, week, month, year, last_60_minutes, last_24_hours, last_7_days, last_30_days, or last_12_months
  count: 1           # Optional number of calendar units for hour/day/week/month/year
  offset: -1         # Optional offset (e.g., -1 for yesterday/previous period)
```
Displays a relative time period. The card supports two types, inspired by the options in the energy date picker:

***Calendar-based periods*** (`hour`, `day`, `week`, `month`, `year`):
- "day" would e.g. mean today from 00:00 to 23:59 as base date
- `count` includes multiple complete calendar units, ending at the unit selected by `offset`.
- `offset` shifts by the complete period (hours for `hour`, days for `day`, ... )

***Rolling window periods*** (`last_60_minutes`, `last_24_hours`, `last_7_days`, `last_30_days`, `last_12_months`):
- End date is "now"
- `count` does not apply.
- `offset` shifts by hours for `last_60_minutes`, days for `last_24_hours`/`last_7_days`/`last_30_days`, months for `last_12_months`.

**Mode: `fixed`**
```yaml
timespan:
  mode: fixed
  start: "2024-01-01T00:00:00"   # Optional, defaults to start of today
  end: "2024-01-31T23:59:59"     # Optional, defaults to end of start day
```
Display a fixed time range. Dates use ISO 8601 format. If omitted, `start` defaults to the beginning of today and `end` defaults to the end of the start day.

### Header chip

`header.chip` shows a single value on the right side of the card header, similar to the default HA cards. 
The value can be created from existing series, from the current state of an entity, or from a calculation with (multiple) series or entity states.

This feature respects the visible timespan to calculate the values for series.
So you can e.g. sum up the values of the single bars to a total.
The possibility to use calculations and current entity states should hopefully allow to realize more complex ideas. 

```yaml
header:
  chip:
    label: Usage
    unit: kWh
    precision: 1
    metric:
      source: stack
      stack: energy
      reducer: sum
      sign: positive
```

The chip text is rendered as `label value unit`. If `label` is omitted, only the value and unit are shown. If `unit` is omitted, the card uses an automatic unit for simple series, stack, and entity-state metrics when possible. For calculation metrics you have to set `unit` explicitly.

| Key | Type | Default | Description |
| --- | ---- | ------- | ----------- |
| `label` | string | – | Text shown before the value. |
| `unit` | string | auto | Unit shown after the value. Leave unset for automatic units when possible. |
| `precision` | number | `tooltip_precision` or `2` | Maximum number of decimal places. |
| `metric` | object | – | Value source and calculation. |

Metric sources:

```yaml
# Existing series by series id
metric:
  source: series
  series_id: grid_import
  reducer: sum

# All series with the same stack key
metric:
  source: stack
  stack: energy
  reducer: sum
  sign: positive

# Current HA entity state
metric:
  source: entity_state
  entity_id: sensor.current_power
```

Calculation metrics combine scalar terms:

```yaml
header:
  chip:
    label: Net
    unit: kWh
    metric:
      calculation:
        initial_value: 0
        terms:
          - source: series
            series_id: grid_import
            reducer: sum
          - operation: subtract
            source: series
            series_id: grid_export
            reducer: sum
```

Supported reducer functions are `sum`, `mean`, `min`, `max`, `first`, and `last`.

For stacks, `sign` controls which values are used: `signed` (default), `positive` (omit negative values), `negative` (omit positive values), or `absolute` (uses Math.abs() on the values).

Metric sources and calculation terms support `multiply`, `add`, `clip_min`, and `clip_max`. Calculation metrics also support those transforms on the final result.

### `series` options

| Key | Type | Default | Description |
| --- | ---- | ------- | ----------- |
| `id` | string | auto in editor | Stable identifier used by header metrics. YAML users should set this when referencing the series from `header.chip`. |
| `name` | string | entity name | Display name shown in tooltip and legend. |
| `source` | `"statistic"`, `"calculation"`, `"forecast"` | inferred | Data source type. When omitted the card can auto-detect the source based on the other fields for `statistic` and `calculation` signals. Use `forecast` to plot solar forecasts configured in the Energy dashboard. |
| `statistic_id` | string | – | Entity with long term statistics (e.g. `sensor.entity_id`). Required unless series uses a `calculation` instead. |
| `attribute` | string | – | Read values from this entity attribute instead of the entity state. See [Entity attribute series](#entity-attribute-series). |
| `stat_type` | `"change"`, `"sum"`, `"mean"`, `"min"`, `"max"`, `"state"` | `"change"` (`"mean"` with `attribute`) | Statistic type to display for this entity. Not used when `calculation` is provided, as each subseries has it's own setting there. |
| `time_offset` | object | – | Fetch this statistic or calculation series from a shifted source timespan and display it in the visible timespan. See below. |
| `calculation` | object | – | Build a computed series from multiple statistics / terms (see below). |
| `chart_type` | `"bar"`, `"line"`, `"step"` | `"bar"` | Chart type. |
| `stack` | string | – | Stack key for combining series. Series with identical keys will get stacked on top of each other. |
| `y_axis` | `"left"`, `"right"` | `"left"` | Axis assignment. |
| `show_in_legend` | boolean | `true` | Whether to display this series in the legend. If `false`, the series remains visible in the chart but has no legend entry. |
| `show_in_tooltip` | boolean | `true` | Controls whether the series appears in the tooltip. Set to `false` to keep the graph visible while hiding numbers from the hover tooltip. |
| `show_value_labels` | boolean | `false` | For unstacked bar charts only: show static value labels at the outer end of each non-zero bar. Ignored for stacked bars. |
| `value_label_precision` | number | `0` | Decimal places for value labels. Units are not shown in value labels. |
| `show_in_chart` | boolean | `true` | When `false`, the series is loaded and can be used by header metrics, but is not rendered in the chart, legend, tooltip, or axis calculation. |
| `hidden_by_default` | boolean | `false` | Whether the series is initially hidden when the chart loads. The series can still be toggled via the legend. |
| `color` | string | next in palette | Specific color (supports `#rrggbb`, `rgb()` or CSS variables). |
| `compare_color` | string | inherit | Optional color for compare series. Defaults to the base series color with reduced opacity. |
| `line_opacity` | number | style default | Override stroke opacity (0–1). Defaults to 0.85 for line charts and 1.0 for bar outlines. |
| `line_width` | number | `1.5` | Line thickness in pixels (line charts only). |
| `line_style` | `"solid"`, `"dashed"`, `"dotted"` | `"solid"` | Line pattern style (line charts only). |
| `fill` | boolean | `false` | Fill the area underneath the line. |
| `fill_opacity` | number | style default | Override fill opacity (0–1). Defaults to 0.15 for line charts and 0.5 for bars. |
| `gradient_fill` | boolean | `false` | For filled line/step charts: fade the fill towards the zero line. Without `fill_opacity`, the gradient uses 0.75 at the stronger side and 0.25 at the zero line. With `fill_opacity`, that value is used for the stronger side and the zero-line alpha is one third of it. |
| `fill_to_series` | string | – | For line charts only: name of another line series to fill towards. Both series must not be stacked. |
| `smooth` | boolean or number | `true` | Line smoothing. Use `false` to disable and true for the default HA behavior. Or provide a value between 0 and 1 for finer control. |
| `multiply` | number | `1` | Apply a multiplier to each series value. |
| `add` | number | `0` | Apply an additive offset after multiplication. |
| `clip_min` | number | – | Values will be set to this value if they are smaller. |
| `clip_max` | number | – | Values will be set to this value if they are larger. |
| `pv_production_entity` | string | – | (Forecast only) Sensor entity you configured as PV production in the Energy dashboard. Leave unset to sum all configured forecasts. |

#### Series time offset

`time_offset` shifts the source timespan for a statistic or calculation series. The card loads data from that shifted range and then projects the timestamps back into the visible chart range.

```yaml
series:
  - statistic_id: sensor.pv_generation
    name: This year
  - statistic_id: sensor.pv_generation
    name: Previous year
    time_offset:
      value: -1
      unit: year
```

Supported units are `hour`, `day`, `week`, `month`, and `year`. `value` must be a whole number; `0` is treated like no offset.

For calculation series, `time_offset` applies to the whole calculation output. Individual calculation terms cannot have separate offsets.

Series time offset only works with aggregated recorder statistics. It cannot be used with RAW history data. Forecast series are not supported.

The Home Assistant energy date picker's compare feature is not supported for charts that configure a time offset and will be ignored.

#### Entity attribute series

Set `attribute` next to `statistic_id` to plot a numeric attribute of an entity, for example the current temperature of a climate entity. Home Assistant does not keep long-term statistics for attributes, so the card reads them from recorder history (with attributes) and aggregates them itself:

- With `raw` aggregation every attribute change is one point.
- With a statistic aggregation (`5minute`, `hour`, `day`, …) the card builds buckets like the recorder: `mean` is time-weighted, `min` / `max` are the extremes, `state` / `sum` are the last value, and `change` is the difference between the last value and the value at the start of the bucket.

```yaml
series:
  - statistic_id: climate.living_room
    attribute: current_temperature
    name: Living room
    stat_type: mean
    chart_type: line
```

Notes:

- Attribute series are limited by the recorder's history retention (`purge_keep_days`, default 10 days). Older ranges have no data.
- Attributes carry no unit; set `y_axes[].unit` if you want one shown.
- Attribute changes are always requested with `significant_changes_only: false`, independent of `raw_options`.
- Numeric strings and booleans (`on/off`, `true/false`) are converted like entity states. Non-numeric values render as gaps.
- `attribute` also works in calculation terms.

#### Calculated series

Configure `calculation` instead of `statistic_id` to compute a series from multiple entity statistics. Terms are processed sequentially, starting with the `initial_value` (default `0`).

> **RAW data behaviour:** When you combine raw history series, the card reuses the most recent available value for each term at the evaluated timestamp. This “last-known value” fallback keeps calculations stable even if sensors don’t report at identical times.
>
> **Constant-only calculations:** If every term is a constant, the card creates simulated points across the visible time range. That makes it easy to draw horizontal reference lines or to use as a baseline for filling signals stacked on top.

| Key | Type | Default | Description |
| --- | ---- | ------- | ----------- |
| `terms` | list | – | Ordered list of calculation steps. |
| `initial_value` | number | `0` | Start value before the first term. |
| `unit` | string | inferred | Unit for the resulting series (inferring looks for the first statistic used). |

Each term accepts the following options:

| Key | Type | Default | Description |
| --- | ---- | ------- | ----------- |
| `operation` | `"add"`, `"subtract"`, `"multiply"`, `"divide"` | `"add"` | Operation applied in this step of the calculation. |
| `constant` | number | – | Constant number to use in this term. Use alternatively to providing a `statistic_id`. All keys below in this section are ignored in this case. |
| `statistic_id` | string | – | Entity with long term statistics (e.g. `sensor.entity_id`). Do not use in combination with setting `constant` in the same term. |
| `attribute` | string | – | Read values from this entity attribute instead of the entity state. See [Entity attribute series](#entity-attribute-series). |
| `stat_type` | `"change"`, `"sum"`, `"mean"`, `"min"`, `"max"`, `"state"` | inherit | Statistic type to display for this entity. |
| `multiply` | number | `1` | Apply a multiplier to each series value. |
| `add` | number | `0` | Apply an additive offset after multiplication. |
| `clip_min` | number | – | Values will be set to this value if they are smaller. |
| `clip_max` | number | – | Values will be set to this value if they are larger. |

#### Solar forecast series

Set `source: forecast` on a series to render a solar forecasts used in the  Home Assistant energy dashboard settings. Only these are accessable through the websocket API.  
Requirements:

- In *Settings → Dashboards → Energy* you must assign at least one solar forecast integration in a PV production entry.
- Forecast data is retrieved via the `energy/solar_forecast` WebSocket API. The card always works in kWh. Convert using `multiply`/`add` if you need another unit.
- Optional `pv_production_entity` limits the series to the forecasts assigned to this PV production sensor entity in the energy dashboard settings. When omitted, the card sums all available forecasts.

Example:

```yaml
series:
  - source: forecast
    pv_production_entity: sensor.rooftop_pv_energy
    chart_type: line
    name: PV forecast
```

All display options (colors, stacking, smoothing, etc.) work exactly like for statistic-based series.

#### Fill between line series

Set `fill_to_series` on a line series to fill the area between this and the targeted line. The value must match the `name` of the target series. Requirements:

- Both series must be rendered as lines (no bars) and must not use stacking.
- The referenced `name` has to be unique within the card configuration.
- When the upper series drops below the lower one, the card sets the fill to zero and logs a warning.
- The fill_opacity used is the one configured on the upper series (or the default if unspecified).
- `gradient_fill` only applies to normal line/step area fills, not to `fill_to_series`.

### `y_axes` options

Configure both left and right Y axes individually. The right axis appears automatically when a series uses `y_axis: right` or when an explicit `right` axis configuration exists.

| Key | Type | Default | Description |
| --- | ---- | ------- | ----------- |
| `id` | `"left"`, `"right"` | – | Axis selector to override (`left` is primary). |
| `min` | number | auto | Minimum axis value. **Note:** Ignored when `center_zero` is active. |
| `max` | number | auto | Maximum axis value. When `center_zero` is active, this value is used for both positive and negative bounds (e.g., `max: 10` creates range -10 to +10). |
| `fit_y_data` | boolean | `false` | Force this axis to fit its data range tightly. |
| `center_zero` | boolean | `false` | Center the axis around zero by making min/max symmetric (e.g., -10 to +10). Useful for visualizing values from different y-axes with zero aligned. If `max` is not set, it will be calculated from the data. |
| `logarithmic_scale` | boolean | `false` | Apply logarithmic scaling to this axis. |
| `unit` | string | metadata | Override unit label for this axis. |

### Aggregation options

Possibility to override the aggregation interval. By default, the card mirrors HA’s energy cards (hours for daily, days for weekly/monthly, months for yearly ranges).

```yaml
aggregation:
  manual: hour          # Used when the card is not linked to the energy date picker
  fallback: day         # Used if the preferred aggregation returns no data
  energy_picker:
    day: 5minute
    week: hour
    month: day
    year: month
```

- `manual` applies when the timespan mode is `relative` or `fixed` (energy date picker not used).
- `energy_picker` sets the aggregation used when the energy date picker selects `hour`, `day`, `week`, `month`, or `year` ranges. Any range not listed keeps the default value.
- `fallback` Optional. Is used if the preferred interval returns no data.
- Valid intervals: `"5minute"`, `"hour"`, `"day"`, `"week"`, `"month"`, `"year"`, `"raw"`, `"disabled"`.
- The X axis follows monthly or yearly labels and grid lines when the resolved aggregation interval is `"month"` or `"year"`.
- Use `"raw"` to fetch recorder history states without aggregation. Use `"disabled"` to skip the request entirely and show a “choose a shorter period” message instead.
- `compute_current_hour` (boolean) creates a live estimate for the ongoing hour by combining the most recent 5 minute statistics until Home Assistant publishes the official hourly aggregate.

> **Heads up:** Enabling `compute_current_hour` issues an extra 5 minute statistics query every few minutes while the current hour is visible. This increases database load slightly, so only enable it when you need near real-time hourly numbers.

> **Autoamtic raw data mapping:** When you use RAW history, boolean-like strings (`on/off`, `open/closed`, `true/false`) are automatically mapped to the numbers `1/0` so binary sensors can be rendered as numeric lines.

Tip: use fine intervals only for short ranges to avoid excessive resource usage and loading times.

### 5. Binary sensor with short ranges in RAW and disabled long ranges

This setup draws a step line for a binary sensor. RAW history is used for the shortest two picker ranges, while longer ranges disable fetching and prompt the user to select a shorter period.

```yaml
type: custom:energy-custom-graph-card
title: Garage door activity
series:
  - statistic_id: binary_sensor.garage_door
    name: Garage door
    stat_type: state
    chart_type: step
    smooth: false
aggregation:
  energy_picker:
    hour: raw
    day: raw
    week: disabled
    month: disabled
    year: disabled
```

### 6. Hourly consumption with live current hour

```yaml
type: custom:energy-custom-graph-card
title: Consumption
aggregation:
  energy_picker:
    hour: hour
    day: day
  compute_current_hour: true
series:
  - statistic_id: sensor.energy_import
    name: Import
    stat_type: change
    chart_type: bar
  - statistic_id: sensor.energy_solar
    name: Solar
    stat_type: change
    chart_type: bar
```

With `compute_current_hour` enabled the card keeps the current hour up to date using 5 minute statistics, while historical hours continue to come from Home Assistant’s long-term database.

## Tips

- Ensure recorder and long-term statistics are enabled for every entity you plan to use.
- Use the relative period mode with positive or negative offsets to jump by whole days, weeks, months, or years.
- When using `fill_to_series`, keep `name` values unique and avoid stacking for the involved series.
- When using multiple energy date pickers on a single dashboard, provide the appropriate `collection_key` so the card links to the correct selection.
- Combine `multiply` and `add` to convert units (e.g. Wh to kWh) without the need for extra template sensors.
